# date-day-calendar
Hello, and welcome to my first project! 
This project is a simple yet useful tool that allows users to determine the day of the week for any given date. By taking input from the user in the format of day, month, and year, the program processes the data and returns the corresponding weekday (e.g., Monday, Tuesday, etc.).  

Features: 
1. Accepts user input for any valid date  
2. Calculates the day of the week accurately  
3. User-friendly and easy to use  
4. Can handle historical and future dates  
5. Takes care of leap years

Hope you like it <br>
